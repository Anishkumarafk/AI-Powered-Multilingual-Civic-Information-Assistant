# AI-Powered-Multilingual-Civic-Information-Assistant

We are building a voice-first, multilingual AI civic assistant accessible through web. This platform allows its users to speak naturally in their preferred regional language. 

The core idea is this platform converts speech to text using cloud speech services such as Amazon Polly. This text is then processed by an AI language model. The AI model then retrieves the relevant information from the curated knowledge base looking for government schemes or public resources.

A simple and personalised response is generated which is provided in both readable text and voice output.
